# Task List: Download Link Feature Implementation

## Relevant Files

- `modal_webendpoint/modal_webendpoint.py` - Main FastAPI application that handles file uploads and serves the web interface.
- `modal_webendpoint/templates/index.html` - Frontend template that displays logs and will need the download card UI.
- `modal_webendpoint/templates/index.html` - Frontend JavaScript that handles log streaming and will need download functionality.
- `modal_webendpoint/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for the web endpoint.
- `prototype_download_endpoint.py` - New prototype endpoint for testing download functionality.
- `prototype_download_template.html` - New prototype HTML template for testing download UI.

### Notes

- The current implementation uses Modal volumes to store uploaded datasets and processed HF datasets.
- The frontend uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream logs from the backend.
- The download functionality will need to integrate with the existing Modal volume storage system.
- No authentication is required for this MVP feature.
- We'll start with a minimal prototype to derisk the technical implementation.
