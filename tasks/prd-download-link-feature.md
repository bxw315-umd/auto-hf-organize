# Product Requirements Document: Download Link Feature

## Introduction/Overview

The Modal web app currently allows users to upload raw experiment data, which gets organized into Hugging Face (HF) datasets by a coding agent. However, users currently have no way to download their processed datasets after the organization is complete. This feature will add a download link that appears after the final response, allowing users to directly download their organized HF dataset from the Modal volume.

**Problem:** Users cannot access their processed datasets after the organization workflow completes.

**Goal:** Provide a simple, one-click download mechanism for users to retrieve their organized HF datasets.

## Goals

1. **Enable Dataset Access:** Allow users to download their processed HF datasets directly from the web interface
2. **Simplify User Experience:** Provide a single-click download option that requires no technical knowledge
3. **Complete the Workflow:** Bridge the gap between dataset processing and dataset retrieval
4. **Maintain Simplicity:** Keep the interface clean and intuitive for non-technical researchers

## User Stories

1. **Primary User Story:** As a researcher with no computer science background, I want to download my organized HF dataset after processing so that I can use it in my research workflow.

2. **Secondary User Story:** As a researcher, I want the download to start immediately when I click the download link so that I don't have to wait for additional processing.

3. **Error Handling Story:** As a researcher, I want to be able to retry the download if it fails so that I can still access my processed dataset.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Download Link Display:** The system must display a download link/card after the final response from the coding agent is logged.

2. **Direct Download:** The system must provide a direct download link that points to the organized HF dataset stored in the Modal volume.

3. **One-Click Access:** The system must allow users to download the dataset with a single click, requiring no additional authentication or technical setup.

4. **Retry Functionality:** The system must allow users to click the download button again if the initial download fails.

5. **Browser Integration:** The system must leverage the browser's native download functionality to show download progress and speed.

6. **Post-Processing Placement:** The download link must appear after the final response is logged, not during the processing phase.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Authentication:** No user authentication or access restrictions will be implemented for this MVP.
2. **File Size Limitations:** No artificial file size restrictions will be imposed.
3. **Compression Requirements:** No specific compression or file format requirements beyond what the browser handles natively.
4. **Download History:** No tracking or history of downloads will be maintained.
5. **Advanced Error Handling:** No complex error recovery mechanisms beyond simple retry functionality.
6. **Progress Indicators:** No custom progress indicators beyond browser-native download progress.

## Design Considerations

1. **Download Card Design:** The download link should be presented as a prominent card or button that clearly indicates it's for downloading the processed dataset.

2. **Visual Placement:** The download card should appear after the final response section, making it clear that the download is available once processing is complete.

3. **Button Styling:** The download button should be visually distinct and clearly labeled (e.g., "Download Organized Dataset" or similar).

4. **User Feedback:** The button should provide visual feedback when clicked (e.g., loading state, disabled state during download).

## Technical Considerations

1. **Modal Volume Integration:** The download link should point directly to the organized dataset stored in the Modal volume.

2. **File Serving:** The web app must serve the HF dataset files from the Modal volume storage.

3. **Browser Compatibility:** The download mechanism should work across all modern browsers without requiring additional plugins.

4. **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for failed downloads with retry capability.

## Success Metrics

1. **Functional Success:** Users can successfully download their organized datasets after processing.
2. **User Experience:** Download process requires no technical knowledge or additional steps.
3. **Reliability:** Download links work consistently without requiring manual intervention.
4. **Completion Rate:** High percentage of users who complete the download after processing.

## Open Questions

1. **File Format:** Should the download be a single file, multiple files, or a directory structure?
2. **Naming Convention:** How should the downloaded file(s) be named?
3. **Storage Cleanup:** Should downloaded datasets be automatically cleaned up from Modal volume storage?
4. **Future Enhancements:** What additional features might be needed for a production version (e.g., authentication, download limits, etc.)?

## Implementation Notes

- This is an MVP feature focused on basic functionality
- Manual testing will be used to validate the feature
- The feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing workflow
- Error handling should be minimal but functional
- The download should leverage existing Modal volume storage infrastructure
